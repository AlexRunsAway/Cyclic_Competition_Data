# Cyclic_Competition_Data

This repository contains data and code for "How Cyclic are Real Tournaments?"

All data is collected from published papers or from publicly available data centers (preflib.org and the ANES data page). All data collected is cited in the paper and supplement.

The Estimation_Tools.zip file contains the data, code used to analyze the data, documentation for the code, default settings, and a readme which explains the folder organization and a tutorial for using the code.
